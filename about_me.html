        <p>I'm an aspiring alien abudctee. I haven't yet been abducted by aliens, but I remain hopeful.</p>

        <p>As a second preference, I'd also be open to being possessed by a spirit. Not a malicious one,
            but a regular one that's just trying to kill some time. I think that would at least prove that there are
            some things that modern science can't explain, which I feel would be pretty cool. However, it would really
            suck if it turned out that it wasn't really a demon but a medical disease that was causing me to hallucinate.
            That would be a huge let down. If I'm to be possessed, I'd need some sort of a legally binding guarantee (complete
            with a stamp from the local notary) that it is, in fact, a real demon.</p>
